# The following variables describe your keyboard and can have the same
# values as the XkbModel, XkbLayout, XkbVariant and XkbOptions options
# in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.

# Valid values are defined in /usr/share/doc/keyboard-configuration/xorg.lst

XKBMODEL="pc104"
XKBLAYOUT="us"
XKBVARIANT="dvorak"

# Options:
#  * allow ctrl_alt_bksp to kill X
#  * make caps an additional escape (handy for vim)
#    perhaps though it should be backspace, and just use Ctrl+C in vim?
XKBOPTIONS="terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp,caps:escape"

# If you don't want to use the XKB layout on the console, you can
# specify an alternative keymap.  Make sure it will be accessible
# before /usr is mounted.
